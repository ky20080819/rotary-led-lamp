# Rotary-led-lamp
This project is a birthday gift for my friend.
<br>
As a high school student, this is the most complex project I’ve ever completed.
<br>
I believe this represents the limit of what I’m currently capable of achieving.

Huge thanks to my mom — without her (financial) support, I wouldn’t have been able to complete this project.
